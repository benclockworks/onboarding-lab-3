# Week 3 Lab: Verification

Fill out this readme as required by lab guidance

The testing i adoped for eexcercise 2 was to test all the possible values i could come up with and then I used the switch case and boolean expression to determine wether or not it waas a pass or fail
Doesn't case should outptut hte last value, what must be ensured for the input to have no effect is that there is a stall to the output until there is an appropriate value inputed
